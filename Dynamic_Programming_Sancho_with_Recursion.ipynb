    "### Implementation of the Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "This function implements the backtracking which is mentioned in the paper by Sancho on page 195. This function will be called from the function **check_if_feasible** if an infeasible solution is detected, which can be made feasible by increasing parking at predecessor nodes. If no additional time is mentioned, the function determines the additional parking time needed at the direct predecessor by itself. This is done in a **greedy** manner, by taking the minimum time so that either $f(i,j) = \\gamma_{ij}$ or $f(i,j) = \\alpha_i$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the additional parking time imposed at the predecessor node yields a feasible solution, the earliest feasible arrival time $f(i,j)$ is recalculated with the new parameters and it's feasibility will also be checked. If no further infeasible solution is deteced, the recursion will just return the new parking time at the node $i$ for $f(i,j)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the additional parking time again leads to an infeasible solution, e. g. because the time window for parking at the predecessor node is exceeded, the function will be called again from **add_parking_to_predecessor**, but now with the predecessor node of the current predecessor (2nd order predecessor) and the parking time needed at the 2nd order predecessor in order to make the solution feasible. This procedure is repeated \n",
    "\n",
    "1.) either until a feasible solution is found, in which case the solution found so far is updated or\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) until the algorithm arrived at the source node, which has no predecessor. In this case, the route that was backtracked is infeasible and it´s arcs will be set on a \"blacklist\", so that this particular route will not be considered by the algorithm anymore. Then, the optimal route to node $(i,j)$ is determined."
